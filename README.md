# Hypothesis Testing Checkpoint

This checkpoint is designed to test your understanding of the content from the Hypothesis Testing Cumulative Lab.

Specifically, this will cover:

* Identifying the null and alternative hypotheses
* Identifying Type I and Type II errors in this context
* Calculating a z-score test statistic
* Determining whether we can reject the null hypothesis based on this test statistic
## Your Task: Identifying Likely New Species

### Business Understanding

You are working for a natural resources ecology laboratory, with the goal of identifying new species of salamander. If a salamander sample seems to have different attributes than a similar, known species, then the laboratory can perform genetic testing to confirm the difference. This genetic testing is expensive, so they only want to use it when we have a statistically significant reason to believe that the sample is from a new species.

Before conducting genetic testing, they want evidence that the sample is drawn from a different population than the known species ‚Äî some unknown species. They are willing to conduct unnecessary genetic testing (where it turns out that the sample is actually from the known species) 20% of the time.

In other words, we will be using an 80% significance level, i.e. $\alpha = 0.2$.

We have a new sample, and we want to know whether the sample is drawn from a population that is _smaller_ in length than the known species.

### Data Understanding

You are provided with:

* The mean length of the known species is 90mm. This is also known as $\mu$, the theoretical mean.
* The standard deviation of the known species length is 30mm. This is also known as $\sigma$ (sigma).
* The mean length of the salamander sample is 87mm. This is also known as $\bar{x}$, or sample mean.
* The sample contains 60 salamanders.

### Requirements

#### 1. Identify Null and Alternative Hypotheses

#### 2. Identify Type I and Type II Errors

#### 3. Calculate the z-score Test Statistic

#### 4. Determine Whether We Can Reject the Null Hypothesis
## 1. Identify Null and Alternative Hypotheses

Below we provide six possible hypotheses, labeled "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F".

In this notation, $\bar{x}$ is the mean length of the sample (possibly an unknown species), and $\mu$ is the known species mean length (population).

By default we are assuming that the sample's mean length is the same or greater than the known species mean length. ***We are seeking evidence that the sample's mean length is actually less than that of the known species***. In other words, we are completing a **one-tailed** experiment.

**A**: $\bar{x} \neq \mu$

**B**: $\bar{x} = \mu$

**C**: $\bar{x} \leq \mu$

**D**: $\bar{x} \geq \mu$

**E**: $\bar{x} \lt \mu$

**F**: $\bar{x} \gt \mu$

In the cell below, assign `null_hypothesis` and `alternative_hypothesis` to the appropriate string values.

```python
# CodeGrade step1
# Replace None with appropriate code
null_hypothesis = "D"
alternative_hypothesis = "E"
# Both values should be strings from "A" to "F"
q1_options = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]
```

```python
assert null_hypothesis in q1_options

assert alternative_hypothesis in q1_options
```

## 2. Identify Type I and Type II Errors

Below we provide four possible scenarios, labeled "A", "B", "C", and "D". In two scenarios, an error has occurred, either Type I or Type II. In the other two scenarios, no error occurred.

**A**: We conclude with our statistical test that the sample salamanders **are smaller** than the known species salamanders, and genetic testing reveals that the sample salamanders **actually are from a different species** and are therefore smaller.

**B**: We conclude with our statistical test that the sample salamanders **are smaller** than the known species salamanders, but genetic testing reveals that the sample salamanders **actually are not from a different species** and are not actually smaller.

**C**: We conclude with our statistical test that **we don't have enough evidence to say that the sample salamanders are statistically smaller** than the known species salamanders, but if they had run genetic testing it would have demonstrated that **they are a different species and are in fact smaller**.

**D**: We conclude with our statistical test that **we don't have enough evidence to say that the sample salamanders are statistically smaller** than the known species salamanders, and in fact if they had run genetic testing it would have demonstrated that **they are not a different species**.

In the cell below, assign `type_1_error` and `type_2_error` to the appropriate string values.

```python
# CodeGrade step2
# Replace None with appropriate code
type_1_error = "B"
type_2_error = "C"
# Both values should be strings from "A" to "D"
q2_options = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
```

```python
assert type_1_error in q2_options

assert type_2_error in q2_options
```

## 3. Calculate a z-score Test Statistic

In this case, we have access to the population standard deviation, so we will use this formula for the z-score:

```python
$$ z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} $$
```

Where $\bar{x}$ is the mean length of the salamander sample, $\mu$ is the mean length of the known species (population), $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the known species, and $n$ is the number in the sample.

Calculate $z$ below.

```python
# Run this cell without changes

import scipy.stats as stats
from math import sqrt
import numpy as np
from numbers import Number

# Population mean
mu = 90

# Population standard deviation
sigma = 30

# Mean length of salamander sample
x_bar = 87

# Number of salamanders in the sample
n = 60

# Alpha (1 - confidence level)
alpha = 0.2
# CodeGrade step3
# Replace None with appropriate code
z = (x_bar - mu) / (sigma / math.sqrt(n))
z
```

```python
# z should be a negative floating point value
# (negative since the sample mean is smaller than the known species mean)
assert isinstance(z, Number)
assert z < 0
```

## 4. Determine Whether We Can Reject the Null Hypothesis

Remember that our confidence level is 0.8 ($\alpha = 0.2$). Can we reject the null hypothesis at this confidence level?

Hint: Use the answer from the previous question along with the empirical rule, a Python function, or [this z-table](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~rsims/ma464/standardnormaltable.pdf).

In the cell below, perform any calculations you need, then assign `reject_null_hypothesis` to `True` or `False`.

```python
# CodeGrade step4
# Perform calculations

# Assign this to True or False
reject_null_hypothesis = True

reject_null_hypothesis
```

```python
# This value should be True or False
assert reject_null_hypothesis == True or reject_null_hypothesis == False
```

# SUMMARY

## Null Hypothesis

A null hypothesis ($ ùêª_0 $) is a statement in hypothesis testing that assumes there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables in a population. It represents the default or status quo assumption that researchers try to test against.

> `For example:`

> In a drug effectiveness test:

$ ùêª_0 $: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure.

> In an exam score comparison:

$ ùêª_0 $: The average test scores of two student groups are equal.

The null hypothesis is either rejected or not rejected based on statistical evidence. It is never "proven true," only retained if there isn't enough evidence against it.

## Alternative Hypothesis ($ H_a $ or $ H_1 $)

The alternative hypothesis ($ H_a $ or $ H_1 $)  is the statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and  represents what the researcher wants to prove. It suggests there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship between variables.

` Examples:`
> Drug effectiveness test:

$ H_0 $: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure.

$ H_a $: The new drug lowers blood pressure.

> `Exam score comparison:`

$ H_0 $: The average test scores of two student groups are equal.


$ H_a $: The average test scores of the two groups are different.

The alternative hypothesis is tested using statistical methods, and if strong evidence supports it, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.


## Type I and Type II Errors in Hypothesis Testing
When performing hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur:

### 1. Type I Error (False Positive)

Occurs when we reject the null hypothesis ($ H_0 $) even though it is actually true.

This means we detect an effect or difference that does not actually exist.

The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by $ ùõº $ (significance level).

#### üîπ Example:

A drug is actually ineffective, but the test concludes it works.
A court convicts an innocent person.


### 2. Type II Error (False Negative)

Occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis ($ H_0 $) even though it is actually false.

This means we miss detecting a real effect or difference.

The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by $ ùõΩ $.


üîπ Example:

A drug actually works, but the test concludes it does not.
A court lets a guilty person go free.


`Key Trade-Off:`

Reducing Type I errors (by lowering $ Œ± $) increases the risk of Type II errors, and vice versa. Choosing the right balance depends on the situation‚Äîe.g., in medical trials, avoiding Type I errors is critical.
